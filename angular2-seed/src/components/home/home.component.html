			<h2>Sample app &middot; <span class="clr-delta">Angular 2 RC1</span></h2>
			<p>This is an example app based on Angular 2 RC1. It relies on TypeScript, SystemJS, Gulp and Sass. The project comes with various features you may need to build a typical single page application (SPA). Here are the most important aspects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a routing concept (separate route configuration file)</li>
				<li>login and dashboard view components (authorized/public routes)</li>
				<li>error page handling</li>
				<li>a directive (form inputs)</li>
				<li>a service (authorization)</li>
				<li>a pipe (determine the active route)</li>
				<li>uses es6-shim, Reflect, Rx.js and Zone.js</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The project was developed with an IDE in mind so the Gulp configuration works well with or without an editor that has integrated TypeScript/Sass compilation (like WebStorm or Visual Studio). Gulp is mandatory for the creation of the <strong>Angular 2 bundle</strong> and copying polyfills so you don't need to link to modules from <em>node_modules</em> inside your web app. Gulp can be used for compiling TypeScript/Sass and runnig a local web server with file watchers. There are also Gulp tasks for deploying a production environment: all JavaScript and CSS code will be concatenated into a single file. The <em>index.html</em> contains a minimal pre-processing condition for production.</p>
			<p>Head over to the <a [routerLink]="['/login']">login page</a> to see the components, directives and services in action. There is a sample dashboard view which represents an area for authorized users.</p>
			<p><strong>Browser support:</strong> all major browsers including Internet Explorer 11+, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari</p>

			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<p>The seed comes with a minimal file structure where everything gets compiled inside the <em>app</em> folder. For production, there will be an additional <em>dist/</em> folder containing minified files.</p>
